Forgive me, Father...

00:03:25,704 --> 00:03:27,304
for I have indeed sinned.

Behold!

Behold, a witness to

12
00:05:59,004 --> 00:06:01,803
Mrs. Geary, I do not
wish to be indelicate,

13
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:05,303
but did you pay the
grave-diggers the extra shilling?

14
00:06:05,403 --> 00:06:06,853
What extra shilling?

15
00:06:06,954 --> 00:06:09,553
To bury your father
deeper in the ground.

16
00:06:09,653 --> 00:06:11,553
Resurrectionists pay extra

17
00:06:11,653 --> 00:06:13,704
to be buried two feet
deeper than the rest.

18
00:06:13,803 --> 00:06:17,204
That way, the grave-robbers
can't dig down to their meat

19
00:06:17,303 --> 00:06:18,504
before the sun comes up.

20
00:06:18,603 --> 00:06:21,653
My wife has no business
with the grave-diggers.

21
00:06:23,603 --> 00:06:26,704
Her father will rest
at the regular depth.

22
00:06:36,254 --> 00:06:38,704
Dear God.

23
00:06:38,803 --> 00:06:40,553
There walks a dead man.

24
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:44,603
Who is that?

25
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:46,704
Is hell opened up?

26
00:06:49,204 --> 00:06:52,353
Dear Lord Almighty,
is that your brother?

27
00:07:05,653 --> 00:07:08,704
Before we begin, may we
bow our heads in prayer?

28
00:07:09,903 --> 00:07:14,153
Our Father, which art in heaven,

29
00:07:14,254 --> 00:07:16,204
hallowed be thy name.

30
00:07:16,303 --> 00:07:18,903
Thy kingdom come...

31
00:07:19,004 --> 00:07:23,353
thy will be done on
Earth as it is in Heaven.

32
00:07:23,454 --> 00:07:26,303
Give us this day our daily bread...

33
00:07:35,954 --> 00:07:39,504
For as much as it hath pleased
Almighty God of his great mercy

34
00:07:39,603 --> 00:07:43,403
to take unto himself the soul of
our dear brother, here departed,

35
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:45,903
we therefore commit
his body to the ground.

36
00:07:46,004 --> 00:07:48,053
Earth to Earth...

37
00:07:48,153 --> 00:07:51,553
...ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

38
00:07:51,653 --> 00:07:55,103
In sure and certain
hope of the Resurrection.

39
00:07:58,704 --> 00:08:00,504
We will change our vile body...

40
00:08:04,004 --> 00:08:06,303
according to the mighty working

41
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:10,504
whereby he is able to
subdue all things to himself.

42
00:08:30,403 --> 00:08:31,704
<i>Sir?</i>

43
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:33,504
Mr. Delaney, is it?

44
00:08:34,604 --> 00:08:35,854
Sir?

45
00:08:37,354 --> 00:08:40,153
- James Delaney, is it?
- Who are you?

46
00:08:43,254 --> 00:08:45,453
- They said you were dead.
- I am.

47
00:08:46,553 --> 00:08:48,903
Such a shallow grave
they dug for my father.

48
00:08:49,004 --> 00:08:50,903
Are you short of a
couple of shillings?

49
00:08:51,004 --> 00:08:53,303
He was buried to the depth of my love.

50
00:08:54,504 --> 00:08:56,203
Last years, he disgraced me.

51
00:08:57,303 --> 00:08:58,354
Disgrace?

52
00:08:59,403 --> 00:09:00,953
Hm.

53
00:09:04,553 --> 00:09:07,803
Were those Negro words
he said over the grave?

54
00:09:09,053 --> 00:09:12,104
Madness comes out through
the umbilical cord.

55
00:09:12,203 --> 00:09:16,303
The pox in Africa goes directly to
the brain via these... these worms.

56
00:09:16,403 --> 00:09:17,903
They... they crawl
through your veins.

57
00:09:18,004 --> 00:09:20,303
- Where is he?
- He went to piss.

58
00:09:23,703 --> 00:09:26,953
Any business with him will
be conducted in my presence.

59
00:09:27,053 --> 00:09:29,953
See, I have the advantage,
I have read the will.

60
00:09:31,354 --> 00:09:32,403
Meaning what?

61
00:09:32,504 --> 00:09:34,754
Meaning I need to piss and
need no-one to hold my cock.

62
00:09:34,854 --> 00:09:37,754
Begging the lady's pardon.

63
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:25,604
How came you to know
that your father was dead?

64
00:10:25,703 --> 00:10:28,303
I heard he was sick
and I boarded a ship.

65
00:10:28,403 --> 00:10:32,004
Yes, he was sick from madness.

66
00:10:32,104 --> 00:10:33,653
Hear that?

67
00:10:35,203 --> 00:10:36,754
Bile and bitterness.

68
00:10:36,854 --> 00:10:40,604
Not a single tear from
anyone at the graveside.

69
00:10:45,203 --> 00:10:47,303
I didn't hear any piss at the leather.

70
00:10:47,403 --> 00:10:51,153
Perhaps you had no need, or
perhaps you came out here with...

71
00:10:51,254 --> 00:10:52,553
With a purpose?

72
00:10:52,653 --> 00:10:54,254
James...

73
00:10:54,354 --> 00:10:57,953
- Who are you?
- I'm Thoyt, your father's lawyer.

74
00:10:58,053 --> 00:11:00,004
Smallpox butchered me down to the bone

75
00:11:00,104 --> 00:11:04,203
and, yes, I have other
business than pissing.

76
00:11:04,303 --> 00:11:05,553
You know, in all of London,

77
00:11:05,653 --> 00:11:07,953
only your father believed
you were still alive.

78
00:11:08,053 --> 00:11:10,203
It was a symptom of his madness.

79
00:11:10,303 --> 00:11:14,453
But he would talk to you, stand
on the north bank of the river

80
00:11:14,553 --> 00:11:17,053
and call out to you on the other side.

81
00:11:17,153 --> 00:11:19,504
Yes, I know, I heard him calling.

82
00:11:21,004 --> 00:11:22,254
I'll speak plainly.

83
00:11:22,354 --> 00:11:24,903
Your father drew up a will
of which I am executor.

84
00:11:25,004 --> 00:11:26,903
In it, you are his only heir.

85
00:11:27,004 --> 00:11:31,504
But, James, if you came home
expecting fortune, there is none.

86
00:11:31,604 --> 00:11:34,203
The only legacy is a poisoned chalice.

87
00:11:35,803 --> 00:11:38,453
Talk to me of poison.

88
00:11:40,153 --> 00:11:43,903
Well, it's a small...
strip of coastline,

89
00:11:44,004 --> 00:11:45,604
directly on the other
side of the world,

90
00:11:45,703 --> 00:11:48,703
which your father held by
treaty with the Nootka tribe.

91
00:11:48,803 --> 00:11:50,803
A wasteland.

92
00:11:50,903 --> 00:11:54,553
If America were a pig facing England,

93
00:11:54,653 --> 00:11:56,854
it is right at the pig's arse.

94
00:11:56,953 --> 00:11:59,504
Just rocks and Indians.

95
00:11:59,604 --> 00:12:04,553
The land in your father's
will is not only useless,

96
00:12:04,653 --> 00:12:07,453
it is dangerous to any who owns it.

97
00:12:07,553 --> 00:12:09,453
They're my rocks now.

98
00:12:11,403 --> 00:12:13,254
James...

99
00:12:13,354 --> 00:12:18,354
I can arrange the immediate
transfer of this particular asset.

100
00:12:29,203 --> 00:12:32,104
I'll send you a formal
proposition in writing.

101
00:12:57,504 --> 00:12:59,604
Good day, sir.

102
00:12:59,703 --> 00:13:02,553
These girls arriving are all whores.

103
00:13:04,004 --> 00:13:05,754
They attend the funeral of a widower

104
00:13:05,854 --> 00:13:07,703
'cause they know there'll
be lots of old men.

105
00:13:07,803 --> 00:13:10,153
And that animal from Africa

106
00:13:10,254 --> 00:13:12,453
is here to pick at an
old man's bones, too.

107
00:13:12,553 --> 00:13:15,553
Perhaps we should let
Thoyt deal with the matter.

108
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:18,953
Let's call our carriage.

109
00:13:34,903 --> 00:13:37,854
One thing Africa did not cure...

110
00:13:37,953 --> 00:13:40,254
is that I still love you.

111
00:13:46,153 --> 00:13:51,104
And if you are ever
short of two shillings,

112
00:13:51,203 --> 00:13:52,903
please do not hesitate to ask,

113
00:13:53,004 --> 00:13:55,854
as Africa also served
me incredibly well.

114
00:13:58,403 --> 00:14:02,703
Well, then you will have no
need for legacies now, will you?

115
00:14:02,803 --> 00:14:04,354
We were just leaving.

116
00:14:07,354 --> 00:14:08,504
Hm.

117
00:14:46,604 --> 00:14:49,303
So, gentlemen, let's begin.

118
00:14:49,403 --> 00:14:52,504
A clerk will record
every word that's said,

119
00:14:52,604 --> 00:14:55,354
except when a fellow raises his hand.

120
00:14:55,453 --> 00:15:00,453
Words from a raised hand will not...

121
00:15:00,553 --> 00:15:02,303
enter the record.

122
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:08,104
Now, the issue today
is old man Delaney.

123
00:15:08,203 --> 00:15:11,303
May he rot in hell.

124
00:15:11,403 --> 00:15:15,153
The death of that mad
old bastard was welcome

125
00:15:15,254 --> 00:15:17,303
and, as we thought at the time,

126
00:15:17,403 --> 00:15:21,303
beneficial for the
honourable East India.

127
00:15:21,403 --> 00:15:23,903
But things have changed.

128
00:15:25,354 --> 00:15:28,104
Mr. Thoyt, welcome.

129
00:15:28,203 --> 00:15:30,153
Give us the bad news.

130
00:15:30,254 --> 00:15:35,504
As the late Mr. Delaney's lawyer,
I attended the funeral,

131
00:15:35,604 --> 00:15:37,553
and a ghost appeared...

132
00:15:37,653 --> 00:15:40,903
a son we all thought dead in Africa.

133
00:15:41,004 --> 00:15:43,203
James Keziah Delaney.

134
00:15:45,953 --> 00:15:48,803
Mr. Wilton, I asked
you to do some digging.

135
00:15:48,903 --> 00:15:52,953
Which I have done, sir, and
most entertaining it has been.

136
00:15:53,053 --> 00:15:56,403
In temperament, he takes
after his mad mother.

137
00:15:56,504 --> 00:15:58,403
She was committed as
a resident of Bedlam.

138
00:15:58,504 --> 00:16:00,453
Just stick to what
we know about the boy.

139
00:16:00,553 --> 00:16:02,553
So, at the age of 11,

140
00:16:02,653 --> 00:16:04,903
his exhausted father and
new bride put his son in

141
00:16:05,004 --> 00:16:08,553
as a cadet at the East India Company
military seminary in Woolwich,

142
00:16:08,653 --> 00:16:10,953
the year of our Lord 1798.

143
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:15,104
Delaney's son was a... company boy?

144
00:16:15,203 --> 00:16:18,803
And, Sir Stuart, odd to relate,

145
00:16:18,903 --> 00:16:21,504
the records show he was
once in your own regiment.

146
00:16:21,604 --> 00:16:23,053
Well...

147
00:16:23,153 --> 00:16:26,803
I commanded so many of the
little bastards, I forget.

148
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:29,803
There is a copy of his attendance
record and the year-end report.

149
00:16:29,903 --> 00:16:32,004
Yeah, year end record too.

150
00:16:32,104 --> 00:16:33,854
My God!

151
00:16:33,953 --> 00:16:37,104
Corporal James Keziah Delaney.

152
00:16:37,203 --> 00:16:40,453
"Exceptional.
Exceptional. Exceptional.

153
00:16:40,553 --> 00:16:44,354
Musket, shipcraft,
leadership. Exceptional."

154
00:16:44,453 --> 00:16:48,553
But, sir, then along came
the year of our Lord 1800.

155
00:16:48,653 --> 00:16:50,303
Exceptional in different ways.

156
00:16:50,403 --> 00:16:53,553
I would guess that confidence
allowed his true savage nature

157
00:16:53,653 --> 00:16:55,354
and mother's madness to emerge.

158
00:16:55,453 --> 00:16:57,754
The necks he broke always
belonged to officers.

159
00:16:57,854 --> 00:16:59,903
And then there is the setting ablaze

160
00:17:00,004 --> 00:17:02,303
of a Navy boat in an
experiment with oil

161
00:17:02,403 --> 00:17:04,804
and mashed potatoes while drunk.

162
00:17:04,903 --> 00:17:07,453
And a fight with a
bear in Chancery Lane,

163
00:17:07,554 --> 00:17:12,104
a rebellion against the cooks
for bad custard, started by him,

164
00:17:12,203 --> 00:17:15,503
and he raved about fortunes
and hidden treasures.

165
00:17:15,604 --> 00:17:18,554
He tried to recruit other boys
to go down the river to India,

166
00:17:18,653 --> 00:17:22,104
to trade with Red Indians,
to take gold from the Aztecs.

167
00:17:22,203 --> 00:17:26,453
And more necks, more whores
and more custard. And finally...

168
00:17:26,554 --> 00:17:28,903
I am almost exhausted
in the telling of it.

169
00:17:29,003 --> 00:17:32,453
Finally, in the year of our Lord 1802,

170
00:17:32,554 --> 00:17:35,104
he took himself off to Africa.

171
00:17:37,403 --> 00:17:40,304
Well, now he is returned.

172
00:17:40,403 --> 00:17:44,203
And Delaney's will
leaves him everything.

173
00:17:44,304 --> 00:17:45,903
Including Nootka.

174
00:17:47,653 --> 00:17:51,554
Do we have a copy of the
Nootka Sound treaty yet?

175
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:55,953
Where perhaps our lawyers
could pick it apart?

176
00:17:56,054 --> 00:17:59,503
It's yet to surface,
Sir Stuart. And...

177
00:17:59,604 --> 00:18:02,804
I believe only the original exists.

178
00:18:04,003 --> 00:18:09,804
So, our lengthy negotiations
with the daughter were in vain.

179
00:18:16,354 --> 00:18:21,503
If the will has not been read
and Nootka is so strategic to us,

180
00:18:21,604 --> 00:18:23,804
why don't we just... burn it?

181
00:18:25,054 --> 00:18:26,503
Even if I did,

182
00:18:26,604 --> 00:18:31,054
the son would have natural
priority over the daughter,

183
00:18:31,153 --> 00:18:34,153
according to God's law.

184
00:18:34,253 --> 00:18:38,854
And his return was
purposely in a public way.

185
00:18:38,953 --> 00:18:42,503
Hardly the action of a savage.

186
00:18:42,604 --> 00:18:45,854
Thank you, Mr. Thoyt,
you may leave us.

187
00:18:54,304 --> 00:19:00,054
Mr. Pettifer, I hope the report
from the Africa desk is as thorough

188
00:19:00,153 --> 00:19:03,554
as the one from Mr. Wilton
in the records office.

189
00:19:06,403 --> 00:19:08,403
According to charter records,

190
00:19:08,503 --> 00:19:11,903
he went to Cabinda aboard
a ship called Cornwallis,

191
00:19:12,003 --> 00:19:16,203
then boarded a ship called the
Influence, bound for Antigua.

192
00:19:17,253 --> 00:19:18,804
It was a slave ship.

193
00:19:18,903 --> 00:19:22,253
It sank off the Gold Coast,

194
00:19:22,354 --> 00:19:24,903
and it was assumed Delaney was dead.

195
00:19:25,653 --> 00:19:28,203
Then the rumours began.

196
00:19:30,804 --> 00:19:35,453
There have been rumours about James
Keziah Delaney these past ten years

197
00:19:35,554 --> 00:19:40,703
but in the file I have
put only the facts, sir,

198
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:42,153
not the rumours.

199
00:19:44,554 --> 00:19:46,104
What are the rumours?

200
00:19:46,203 --> 00:19:52,054
Awful, and unnatural,
and, I'm sure, untrue.

201
00:19:53,804 --> 00:19:57,453
What fucking rumours?

202
00:21:16,804 --> 00:21:18,104
Right.

203
00:21:46,604 --> 00:21:49,203
Who's there? This pistol is loaded.

204
00:21:53,903 --> 00:21:55,403
My God.

205
00:21:55,503 --> 00:22:00,003
Perhaps by ship and by
carriage. Hm? Come here.

206
00:22:00,104 --> 00:22:02,003
Ah!

207
00:22:03,354 --> 00:22:07,003
Where's your propriety, Brace?
Servant and master? Get off me.

208
00:22:08,703 --> 00:22:10,354
- Begging your pardon, sir.
- What, why?

209
00:22:10,453 --> 00:22:13,203
Begging your pardon, but what
the hell are you doing here?

210
00:22:13,304 --> 00:22:15,003
Oh, no, there will
be no pardon for you

211
00:22:15,104 --> 00:22:17,354
because you are the
captain of the mutineers.

212
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:23,003
And you will hang. For
being a pirate, you vagabond!

213
00:22:23,104 --> 00:22:24,304
How's the leg?

214
00:22:24,403 --> 00:22:29,304
I broke my left knee swinging
from a tree, being an ape for you.

215
00:22:30,604 --> 00:22:32,253
- You needed a brother.
- Still do.

216
00:22:33,854 --> 00:22:37,753
But a broken down, bent, buckled old
butler will have to be sufficient.

217
00:22:37,854 --> 00:22:39,403
You look the same.

218
00:22:41,203 --> 00:22:42,453
I'm not.

219
00:22:46,003 --> 00:22:48,953
Not tea, brandy.

220
00:22:51,253 --> 00:22:53,304
Two glasses.

221
00:22:53,403 --> 00:22:54,453
Sir?

222
00:22:54,554 --> 00:22:56,003
Fetch two glasses.

223
00:22:57,003 --> 00:23:00,653
They should have invited you.
To the wake, at least.

224
00:23:00,753 --> 00:23:03,903
Serving stew in the backroom,
to hell with that.

225
00:23:04,003 --> 00:23:07,903
In all of this dirty city,
there is no-one that I can trust,

226
00:23:08,003 --> 00:23:09,104
do you understand?

227
00:23:09,203 --> 00:23:11,003
Apart from you.

228
00:23:22,253 --> 00:23:23,304
Ah!

229
00:23:24,703 --> 00:23:28,453
You can spare me the old
maiden splutter, Brace.

230
00:23:28,554 --> 00:23:30,279
I know that you polish
off at least half a bottle

231
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:33,253
of Delaney Company
Brandy every night.

232
00:23:33,354 --> 00:23:34,703
Hm?

233
00:23:42,403 --> 00:23:43,604
James...

234
00:23:45,354 --> 00:23:47,753
You could have written
to your father just once.

235
00:23:47,854 --> 00:23:50,453
In the end, he was calling for you.

236
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:51,653
I know.

237
00:23:53,253 --> 00:23:56,703
I'd say, "Come on, come in.

238
00:23:56,804 --> 00:23:59,104
Before the tide gets your shoes."

239
00:23:59,203 --> 00:24:02,453
And he would light
these fires on the shore,

240
00:24:02,554 --> 00:24:04,804
call out your name and talk to you.

241
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:08,804
Is that grief, James?

242
00:24:10,003 --> 00:24:11,304
Is what grief?

243
00:24:14,304 --> 00:24:20,003
And all the while, these gulls
hovered around picking at him.

244
00:24:20,104 --> 00:24:22,903
Gulls only come if there is meat.

245
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:25,604
Oh, aye, meat there was.

246
00:24:26,753 --> 00:24:29,354
Men of affairs, they call themselves.

247
00:24:29,453 --> 00:24:32,104
Don't you want to know what
it is they wanted, these gulls?

248
00:24:32,203 --> 00:24:33,804
I know already.

249
00:24:34,604 --> 00:24:36,653
I doubt that.

250
00:24:38,604 --> 00:24:42,153
A base of land called Nootka Sound.

251
00:24:43,854 --> 00:24:45,854
Nootka was my mother's tribe.

252
00:24:47,604 --> 00:24:49,854
No. No, no, James.

253
00:24:49,953 --> 00:24:52,703
Your mother came from Naples.

254
00:24:52,804 --> 00:24:56,203
He bought some land
and he bought a wife.

255
00:24:57,554 --> 00:25:00,003
And he bought them both for gunpowder.

256
00:25:03,604 --> 00:25:07,054
He told me never to speak
to you of buying her.

257
00:25:08,403 --> 00:25:10,253
And yet he told me everything.

258
00:25:12,003 --> 00:25:13,253
When?

259
00:25:13,354 --> 00:25:15,403
When he lit his fires
on the foreshore.

260
00:25:20,304 --> 00:25:23,054
Nothing you could tell me about
that man would surprise me.

261
00:25:23,153 --> 00:25:27,903
He was half human at the end
and he would squat right here and

262
00:25:28,003 --> 00:25:31,503
make deals with ghosts in the flames.

263
00:25:32,703 --> 00:25:34,804
And he would speak in a
language that was like...

264
00:25:34,903 --> 00:25:37,003
It was like ravens fighting.

265
00:25:42,104 --> 00:25:45,304
And he would talk to you, James.

266
00:25:45,403 --> 00:25:46,854
And he would talk to Anna.

267
00:25:49,054 --> 00:25:50,104
Salish.

268
00:25:56,503 --> 00:25:58,653
My mother's name was Salish.

269
00:26:00,003 --> 00:26:03,503
You know things only he and I knew.

270
00:26:03,604 --> 00:26:05,153
Yeah.

271
00:26:07,503 --> 00:26:10,854
And it's best we never talk
of her when we've had brandy.

272
00:26:16,403 --> 00:26:19,253
See, when you live alone
with a madman, you...

273
00:26:19,354 --> 00:26:21,503
You become half mad yourself.

274
00:26:23,503 --> 00:26:27,153
But here's the thing, James.
This Nootka Sound is a curse.

275
00:26:27,253 --> 00:26:31,203
It will bring the King and
Empire down upon your head.

276
00:26:31,304 --> 00:26:34,003
Please don't talk to
me of sense, Brace,

277
00:26:34,104 --> 00:26:38,304
because if it is you,
I might believe it.

278
00:26:40,403 --> 00:26:44,653
And I have sworn to
do very foolish things.

279
00:28:12,403 --> 00:28:16,054
If you're looking for money,
those accounts are ten years old.

280
00:28:19,804 --> 00:28:23,104
Where are my father's
inventories and his shipping logs?

281
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:26,354
He burnt them all.

282
00:28:28,153 --> 00:28:31,453
The only reason these accounts
survived was because I hid them

283
00:28:31,554 --> 00:28:33,354
in case the taxman came knocking.

284
00:28:35,104 --> 00:28:37,054
That was delivered at 6 AM this morning

285
00:28:37,153 --> 00:28:39,753
by a servant of Mr. Robert Thoyt.

286
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:44,304
Thoyt has been trying to buy
the Delaney Shipping Company

287
00:28:44,403 --> 00:28:46,153
from your father for three years.

288
00:28:46,253 --> 00:28:48,304
Each time, your da
would go into the street,

289
00:28:48,403 --> 00:28:51,903
scoop up some horse shite and
package it up by way of reply.

290
00:28:54,903 --> 00:28:59,903
I imagine the envelope
contains a financial offer.

291
00:29:00,003 --> 00:29:03,153
I imagine it does. Do you
have any horse shit on you?

292
00:29:08,653 --> 00:29:13,003
Listen, the accounts told me that
we have a leasehold of 50 years

293
00:29:13,104 --> 00:29:16,253
on the offices in West India
docks, 32 years left to run.

294
00:29:17,403 --> 00:29:20,703
Your father hadnae been up
there in eight years, sir.

295
00:29:20,804 --> 00:29:22,503
They're all locked up.

296
00:29:22,604 --> 00:29:24,104
Then I will need the key.

297
00:30:22,453 --> 00:30:23,753
Oi!

298
00:30:23,854 --> 00:30:25,953
What are you doing with the door?

299
00:30:26,054 --> 00:30:28,804
You want a bush, you come through me.

300
00:30:28,903 --> 00:30:30,554
That is private property.

301
00:30:30,653 --> 00:30:34,304
Helga, it's so good to see
that you're still working...

302
00:30:34,403 --> 00:30:35,903
even still alive.

303
00:30:36,003 --> 00:30:38,503
You know that I lay with you
when I was just a little boy.

304
00:30:38,604 --> 00:30:40,153
Where did you get the key?

305
00:30:40,253 --> 00:30:43,003
This key? This is my father's key.

306
00:30:43,104 --> 00:30:46,304
Horace Delaney. Mmm?

307
00:30:48,003 --> 00:30:49,703
Shit.

308
00:30:49,804 --> 00:30:51,054
Yes, shit.

309
00:30:52,203 --> 00:30:54,503
Your father stopped
coming. It was empty.

310
00:30:54,604 --> 00:30:57,554
It was wasted, so close to the docks.

311
00:31:00,804 --> 00:31:02,203
You want tea?

312
00:31:02,304 --> 00:31:03,403
No.

313
00:31:05,703 --> 00:31:07,054
Do you want to fuck?

314
00:31:07,153 --> 00:31:09,753
- No, I want my family offices back.
- Oh, God.

315
00:31:12,403 --> 00:31:13,804
How much do you make here?

316
00:31:17,003 --> 00:31:20,804
With the workers in the yard and
the boats that moor at the wharf...

317
00:31:21,804 --> 00:31:23,453
we make Â£10 a day.

318
00:31:23,554 --> 00:31:26,653
I can give you five
and whatever you like.

319
00:31:26,753 --> 00:31:29,953
Boys, girls, suck, fuck...

320
00:31:31,403 --> 00:31:34,104
You have two hours to get out.

321
00:31:34,203 --> 00:31:35,703
You say I took your cherry.

322
00:31:37,804 --> 00:31:38,953
Mm-hmm.

323
00:31:42,854 --> 00:31:44,903
Where have you been, little boy?

324
00:31:45,003 --> 00:31:46,854
- I have been in the world.
- Oh.

325
00:31:49,403 --> 00:31:52,903
I have girls, but I also have men.

326
00:31:54,753 --> 00:31:56,304
They're not very good men.

327
00:31:56,403 --> 00:31:57,804
- You understand?
- Mm-hmm.

328
00:31:59,453 --> 00:32:01,203
They have rocks for hearts.

329
00:32:01,304 --> 00:32:03,604
They have knives and ropes.

330
00:32:03,703 --> 00:32:05,153
If you have any sense...

331
00:32:09,104 --> 00:32:12,604
People who do not know
me soon come to understand

332
00:32:12,703 --> 00:32:14,403
that I do not have any sense.

333
00:32:16,604 --> 00:32:18,443
Now, please do not
misunderstand the situation.

334
00:32:18,503 --> 00:32:19,604
You send me 12 men,

335
00:32:19,703 --> 00:32:22,953
I will return you 12 sets
of testicles in a bag,

336
00:32:23,054 --> 00:32:26,104
and we can watch your little
whores devour them together,

337
00:32:26,203 --> 00:32:30,253
before I chop off your
trotters and boil them.

338
00:32:35,153 --> 00:32:36,203
Two hours.

339
00:32:37,703 --> 00:32:39,054
You...

340
00:32:39,153 --> 00:32:41,153
I remember you.

341
00:32:41,253 --> 00:32:44,003
I remember you. Heard the stories.

342
00:32:46,203 --> 00:32:48,804
If I give you a girl, I
will never see her again.

343
00:32:50,453 --> 00:32:51,653
You heard right.

344
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:54,403
Be punctual.

345
00:33:13,703 --> 00:33:17,054
- They've brought the carriage up.
- Yes. I'm coming.

346
00:33:39,054 --> 00:33:41,503
You're not imploring him
to relinquish his deed,

347
00:33:41,604 --> 00:33:43,554
you're insisting that,
for his own welfare,

348
00:33:43,653 --> 00:33:45,604
he submit his claim to you.

349
00:33:47,354 --> 00:33:51,203
Implore is a more feminine word.

350
00:33:53,604 --> 00:33:55,503
And why must you be a woman to him?

351
00:33:59,104 --> 00:34:03,153
The offer of Â£50 should be
conditional on him leaving England.

352
00:34:03,253 --> 00:34:05,003
Why?

353
00:34:05,104 --> 00:34:08,204
Because if he does not leave
England, I will kill him.

354
00:34:08,304 --> 00:34:09,603
Why?

355
00:34:15,853 --> 00:34:17,503
That is a very good question.

356
00:34:20,704 --> 00:34:24,353
Why would I feel that way about
him, after meeting him only once?

357
00:34:26,304 --> 00:34:29,153
The son of the same father
as the woman I love...

358
00:34:32,804 --> 00:34:35,304
Why does a soldier know
that a nigger bowing low

359
00:34:35,403 --> 00:34:38,003
has a dagger in his shoe
and is reaching for it?

360
00:34:42,103 --> 00:34:45,103
Delaney is nothing
more than a nigger now.

361
00:34:45,204 --> 00:34:46,603
You know that, don't you?

362
00:34:49,804 --> 00:34:53,503
I have talked with seasoned
merchants who could barely

363
00:34:53,603 --> 00:34:55,954
bring themselves to
repeat these stories.

364
00:34:59,253 --> 00:35:00,603
Among Christian soldiers,

365
00:35:00,704 --> 00:35:05,204
it's customary to bury the
bodies of your fallen enemy

366
00:35:05,304 --> 00:35:09,704
and shoo away the dogs and
crows that come for the carrion.

367
00:35:12,554 --> 00:35:14,403
Not kneel down beside them.

368
00:35:27,753 --> 00:35:29,804
Try again,

369
00:35:29,903 --> 00:35:33,304
this time reflecting the
disgust you naturally feel

370
00:35:33,403 --> 00:35:34,903
now you know the truth.

371
00:35:43,853 --> 00:35:45,003
Hmm?

372
00:36:01,204 --> 00:36:04,954
The dogs here live off
the flesh from suicides

373
00:36:05,054 --> 00:36:07,003
jumping off Blackfriars Bridge.

374
00:36:08,204 --> 00:36:11,204
Never known one go
tamely to a man's hand.

375
00:36:12,653 --> 00:36:15,454
Must be some witchcraft
you picked up somewhere.

376
00:36:19,054 --> 00:36:20,353
What do you want?

377
00:36:22,304 --> 00:36:26,353
You think your father's
kid feeds himself.

378
00:36:26,454 --> 00:36:29,503
I heard you done a
lot of evil over there.

379
00:36:29,603 --> 00:36:33,304
Now it's time for you to do some
bleeding good among your own.

380
00:36:33,403 --> 00:36:38,304
Me and my wife have looked
after that boy for ten years

381
00:36:38,403 --> 00:36:41,753
with not one penny from
you and nothing but threats

382
00:36:41,853 --> 00:36:44,903
from the mad old bastard
you just put in the ground.

383
00:36:45,003 --> 00:36:48,153
Now you're back, I want payment.

384
00:36:48,253 --> 00:36:52,804
If it wasn't for us, that kid
would be sucking cocks in St. Giles.

385
00:36:58,204 --> 00:37:00,704
Mr. Ibbotson, I've been
meaning to pay you a visit.

386
00:37:00,804 --> 00:37:02,054
Bullshit.

387
00:37:02,153 --> 00:37:06,103
You're a liar just like your
father. You're a Delaney.

388
00:37:06,204 --> 00:37:08,054
Tell you what...

389
00:37:08,153 --> 00:37:10,454
You get me an address,

390
00:37:10,554 --> 00:37:13,804
and I will get you payment in
the form of a banker's draft.

391
00:37:15,153 --> 00:37:16,853
- How much?
- Enough.

392
00:37:20,653 --> 00:37:22,003
Good day.

393
00:37:24,804 --> 00:37:27,554
You don't even ask how
your own blood fares.

394
00:38:20,853 --> 00:38:25,353
If you don't approve of me
steadying my nerves with Madeira,

395
00:38:25,454 --> 00:38:27,454
then perhaps you should
consult the directory of

396
00:38:27,554 --> 00:38:30,503
the Royal College of Physicians,
see you know many others of them

397
00:38:30,603 --> 00:38:32,704
will agree to carry
out this kind of work.

398
00:38:32,804 --> 00:38:36,704
I intend to mix the contents of
his stomach with potassium oxide,

399
00:38:36,804 --> 00:38:39,353
calcium oxide and nitric acid.

400
00:38:43,804 --> 00:38:47,403
I'll know in 20 minutes. Come
back when the church bell chimes.

401
00:39:13,403 --> 00:39:15,503
You did this.

402
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:17,304
- You will pay for this.
- No.

403
00:39:26,653 --> 00:39:30,153
No, because I have no
fear to feed you with.

404
00:39:32,153 --> 00:39:34,704
No fear to give you
and I will prove it.

405
00:39:34,804 --> 00:39:39,903
Sing for me like you once did
as the river caught your tongue.

406
00:39:40,003 --> 00:39:42,554
<i>Ee neem sea wo ha ha.</i>

407
00:39:42,653 --> 00:39:43,804
Suicide.

408
00:39:46,003 --> 00:39:48,353
That will teach you
not to steal, won't it?

409
00:39:50,003 --> 00:39:52,403
<i>Ee neem sea wo ha ha.</i>

410
00:39:52,503 --> 00:39:54,804
<i>Ee neem sea wo ha.</i>

411
00:39:58,153 --> 00:40:00,903
You're not here. You are not here.

412
00:40:01,003 --> 00:40:04,304
I have no fear for you and
I have no guilt for you.

413
00:40:09,853 --> 00:40:12,704
I did as others did
and as others had me do,

414
00:40:12,804 --> 00:40:14,554
and we are all owned,

415
00:40:14,653 --> 00:40:16,753
and we have all owned others...

416
00:40:19,653 --> 00:40:23,204
so don't you dare stand
there and judge me.

417
00:40:26,204 --> 00:40:29,853
Today, I have work to do.

418
00:40:56,753 --> 00:41:01,204
The horizontal chamber contains
the gas from the stomach contents.

419
00:41:05,253 --> 00:41:06,304
Now...

420
00:41:07,653 --> 00:41:09,054
the moment of truth.

421
00:41:17,503 --> 00:41:23,054
As you see, the flame has formed
a reflective surface on the glass,

422
00:41:23,153 --> 00:41:25,153
what is known as an arsenic mirror.

423
00:41:27,403 --> 00:41:29,153
Your father was poisoned.

424
00:41:31,804 --> 00:41:34,153
From the density of the mirror,

425
00:41:34,253 --> 00:41:38,204
I would say heavy doses
over a short period,

426
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:42,503
and, yes, it would have affected
his mind in the later stages.

427
00:41:45,804 --> 00:41:47,454
You want him reburied?

428
00:41:47,554 --> 00:41:50,853
Yes, and sewn back up into one piece.

429
00:41:50,954 --> 00:41:53,753
I would recommend they
dig a bit deeper this time.

430
00:41:56,204 --> 00:41:58,804
If this body is used
for any other purpose,

431
00:41:58,903 --> 00:42:01,603
I will find you and I will kill you.

432
00:42:01,704 --> 00:42:04,103
You tell every member
of your profession...

433
00:42:06,304 --> 00:42:08,204
I know things about the dead.

434
00:42:11,003 --> 00:42:12,853
And I will know.

435
00:42:12,954 --> 00:42:16,704
Do you want any words said
over him when we put him back?

436
00:42:16,804 --> 00:42:18,204
No-one is listening.

437
00:42:58,503 --> 00:43:00,403
He's meeting with the East India.

438
00:43:03,503 --> 00:43:06,353
Apparently, they're happy
to deal with the devil

439
00:43:06,454 --> 00:43:07,853
and leave us penniless.

440
00:43:10,204 --> 00:43:12,454
The letter, it seemed, did no good.

441
00:43:12,554 --> 00:43:14,653
He was never one to be told.

442
00:43:16,603 --> 00:43:21,204
Well, we have legal rights, and
it's time that savage was made aware.

443
00:43:21,304 --> 00:43:24,103
- I know he's your brother but...
- Half-brother.

444
00:43:27,403 --> 00:43:29,204
he leaves me no choice.

445
00:43:41,003 --> 00:43:42,704
- I'm going out.
- Good.

446
00:43:42,804 --> 00:43:46,153
I'm tired of these empty threats
you keep bandying around.

447
00:43:49,804 --> 00:43:50,903
Empty?

448
00:43:53,003 --> 00:43:55,103
I'm your husband and you are my wife.

449
00:43:56,804 --> 00:44:00,353
And I will protect our interests
by whatever means necessary.

450
00:44:02,003 --> 00:44:03,704
And as for him,

451
00:44:03,804 --> 00:44:06,153
well, he should have
stayed where he belongs,

452
00:44:06,253 --> 00:44:09,853
in the jungle, dancing
naked and screwing wild pigs,

453
00:44:09,954 --> 00:44:11,753
and his slaves in their chains.

454
00:44:15,753 --> 00:44:17,804
He will leave soon.

455
00:44:17,903 --> 00:44:20,554
You're quite right, he
doesn't belong in this world.

456
00:44:59,954 --> 00:45:02,103
I decided to bring it in person.

457
00:45:07,403 --> 00:45:12,603
Now, this is for the past,
the present and the future.

458
00:45:19,454 --> 00:45:20,753
Take me to the boy.

459
00:45:22,153 --> 00:45:23,903
I want to see if you're
lying to me or not.

460
00:45:24,003 --> 00:45:25,954
Yes, sir, Mr. Delaney.

461
00:45:37,753 --> 00:45:39,503
Do you want to talk with him?

462
00:45:39,603 --> 00:45:43,153
No, I'm not a fit man
to be around children.

463
00:45:48,003 --> 00:45:51,554
Fate can be hard, so you put
money aside for his future in case

464
00:45:51,653 --> 00:45:56,054
he grows up to be rash, like me.

465
00:45:58,103 --> 00:45:59,804
Will you wish to see him again?

466
00:46:01,704 --> 00:46:04,353
No. Not ever.

467
00:47:02,704 --> 00:47:06,403
John Pettifer, East India
Company, Africa desk.

468
00:47:08,403 --> 00:47:10,054
James Delaney.

469
00:47:10,153 --> 00:47:12,454
Benjamin Wilton, records,

470
00:47:12,554 --> 00:47:15,503
Abraham Appleby, our
delegate from Christ,

471
00:47:15,603 --> 00:47:18,403
and this is Sir Stuart Strange,

472
00:47:18,503 --> 00:47:21,353
Chairman of the Honourable
East India Company

473
00:47:21,454 --> 00:47:24,103
across the surface
of the entire Earth.

474
00:47:26,454 --> 00:47:28,003
You don't remember me.

475
00:47:30,153 --> 00:47:31,804
One remembers those one looks up to

476
00:47:31,903 --> 00:47:34,554
more readily than those
you look down upon.

477
00:47:34,653 --> 00:47:36,204
I believe you were a cadet.

478
00:47:36,304 --> 00:47:38,153
Yes, you were my commander.

479
00:47:38,253 --> 00:47:43,853
Oh, well, blame brandy
and old age, hmm?

480
00:47:43,954 --> 00:47:45,603
Please, sit.

481
00:47:55,054 --> 00:47:57,204
- Brandy?
- No.

482
00:47:59,304 --> 00:48:01,804
To begin, may I offer our sincere...?

483
00:48:01,903 --> 00:48:05,954
Please understand...
hypocrisy I hate most.

484
00:48:07,704 --> 00:48:11,204
- Indeed. Let us not pretend...
- No, do not pretend.

485
00:48:12,653 --> 00:48:16,704
I wonder if Mr. Appleby might
be allowed to finish a sentence?

486
00:48:19,204 --> 00:48:20,853
We are told that in
your father's will,

487
00:48:20,954 --> 00:48:25,853
you were bequeathed a piece of
territory which lies just here.

488
00:48:27,204 --> 00:48:28,204
Mm-hmm.

489
00:48:30,003 --> 00:48:33,304
As you will see, the small piece
of land your father bought off

490
00:48:33,403 --> 00:48:37,753
the Indians is now by virtue of
geography a point of contention

491
00:48:37,853 --> 00:48:41,903
between His Majesty's Government
and the cursed United States.

492
00:48:46,804 --> 00:48:48,304
So...

493
00:48:51,153 --> 00:48:52,304
Hmm?

494
00:48:52,403 --> 00:48:56,054
Ah, Mr. Delaney, you've been
in Africa for a number of years,

495
00:48:56,153 --> 00:49:00,204
so you may be unaware that
Britain and the United States

496
00:49:00,304 --> 00:49:02,454
are currently at war.

497
00:49:02,554 --> 00:49:03,903
I know.

498
00:49:04,003 --> 00:49:07,253
Ah, well, you will understand,
then, that private ownership of

499
00:49:07,353 --> 00:49:10,304
the Nootka Sound landing
ground represents an opportunity

500
00:49:10,403 --> 00:49:12,554
for our enemies who
dispute its sovereignty

501
00:49:12,653 --> 00:49:15,903
when the time comes
to draw the border.

502
00:49:16,003 --> 00:49:17,403
I know.

503
00:49:18,903 --> 00:49:20,804
Yes, I know. I also know...

504
00:49:20,903 --> 00:49:23,454
that the British and
American Government

505
00:49:23,554 --> 00:49:26,454
are preparing to begin their
secret peace talks in Ghent,

506
00:49:26,554 --> 00:49:27,903
aren't they?

507
00:49:28,003 --> 00:49:33,103
And negotiators are
preparing depositions to draw

508
00:49:33,204 --> 00:49:36,853
the Canadian-American border for
when the current hostilities end.

509
00:49:36,954 --> 00:49:39,704
And because of the strategical
position of Nootka Sound,

510
00:49:39,804 --> 00:49:42,403
whoever owns it has legal entitlement

511
00:49:42,503 --> 00:49:45,903
to the entire island of Vancouver,

512
00:49:46,003 --> 00:49:47,153
which is...

513
00:49:48,403 --> 00:49:50,304
Well, which is the gateway to...

514
00:49:51,804 --> 00:49:52,853
to China.

515
00:49:55,603 --> 00:49:56,653
Hmm?

516
00:49:59,804 --> 00:50:02,103
So this...

517
00:50:03,253 --> 00:50:06,903
This small piece of
land that my father...

518
00:50:07,003 --> 00:50:09,304
bought for beads,

519
00:50:09,403 --> 00:50:11,503
bless him, and gunpowder,

520
00:50:11,603 --> 00:50:13,853
some 30 years ago,

521
00:50:13,954 --> 00:50:18,304
actually will be very,
very valuable to the Crown

522
00:50:18,403 --> 00:50:20,903
and to the East India,

523
00:50:21,003 --> 00:50:24,704
but also incredibly
valuable to the Americans.

524
00:50:24,804 --> 00:50:28,304
Mr. Delaney, as a British subject,

525
00:50:28,403 --> 00:50:32,204
you owe a debt of loyalty
to your King and country.

526
00:50:34,954 --> 00:50:37,503
If patriotism is not
in your motivation,

527
00:50:37,603 --> 00:50:39,804
perhaps money can be.

528
00:50:41,603 --> 00:50:43,804
Before your unexpected return,

529
00:50:43,903 --> 00:50:47,003
we had agreed a figure
with your half-sister.

530
00:50:47,103 --> 00:50:49,853
Her husband drove a
particularly hard bargain.

531
00:50:50,903 --> 00:50:53,804
I'm sorry, no. Nootka
Sound is not for sale.

532
00:50:55,353 --> 00:50:56,454
Open the envelope.

533
00:50:58,054 --> 00:50:59,103
Are you deaf?

534
00:51:00,153 --> 00:51:02,704
- Oh, Mr. Delaney...
- Mr. Delaney, perhaps...

535
00:51:02,804 --> 00:51:05,954
The Leviathan of the Seas, is it?

536
00:51:06,054 --> 00:51:08,054
The terrible shadow?

537
00:51:09,304 --> 00:51:13,603
The beast with a million
eyes and a million ears?

538
00:51:13,704 --> 00:51:14,804
Conquest?

539
00:51:15,853 --> 00:51:17,054
Rape?

540
00:51:18,204 --> 00:51:19,353
Plunder?

541
00:51:20,804 --> 00:51:23,003
I studied your methods in your school.

542
00:51:24,804 --> 00:51:30,403
And I do know the evil that you
do because I was once part of it.

543
00:51:41,253 --> 00:51:43,554
- Are you sure you won't take a brandy?
- Yes.

544
00:51:43,653 --> 00:51:46,704
Please take a moment to consider
the consequences of your refusal...

545
00:51:46,804 --> 00:51:50,253
What consequences? What consequences?

546
00:51:50,353 --> 00:51:51,853
Perhaps we should adjourn.

547
00:51:51,954 --> 00:51:53,003
Mr. Delaney...

548
00:51:54,403 --> 00:51:57,503
I'll give you one
last chance to behave

549
00:51:57,603 --> 00:52:02,403
like a loyal subject of His Majesty
and the lawful crown of England.

550
00:52:03,853 --> 00:52:06,753
Sell this land for a reasonable price.

551
00:52:14,603 --> 00:52:16,054
Hmm...

552
00:52:18,403 --> 00:52:19,603
Please.

553
00:52:23,403 --> 00:52:28,204
The balance of your father's
mind was, well, unstable...

554
00:52:29,403 --> 00:52:31,853
but you have no such excuse.

555
00:52:31,954 --> 00:52:35,454
Now, why don't you just
open the fucking envelope?

556
00:52:40,454 --> 00:52:41,503
Mmm?

557
00:52:52,153 --> 00:52:53,253
Hmm...

558
00:53:02,403 --> 00:53:04,103
Good day.

559
00:53:16,503 --> 00:53:17,853
Well...

560
00:53:20,353 --> 00:53:24,204
The son is as unstable as the father.

561
00:53:26,204 --> 00:53:28,954
Perhaps the rumours
about him are true.

562
00:53:30,054 --> 00:53:33,403
I'd hoped to settle this
matter in a modern way,

563
00:53:33,503 --> 00:53:36,003
but that's not going to be possible.

564
00:53:40,253 --> 00:53:41,554
He's all yours.

565
00:53:58,353 --> 00:54:02,103
<i>Dear James, the letter I sent
to you this morning was written</i>

566
00:54:02,204 --> 00:54:05,903
<i>under the supervision of my husband,</i>

567
00:54:06,003 --> 00:54:08,454
<i>to whom I am happily married.</i>

568
00:54:12,954 --> 00:54:15,753
<i>It is more than ten years
since you went away,</i>

569
00:54:15,853 --> 00:54:19,054
<i>and at the time I was grateful that
you had decided to leave England,</i>

570
00:54:19,153 --> 00:54:20,704
<i>for both of our sakes.</i>

571
00:54:24,454 --> 00:54:28,103
<i>Whatever happens with this
business of inheritance,</i>

572
00:54:28,204 --> 00:54:31,554
<i>and no matter if it
results in a dispute,</i>

573
00:54:31,653 --> 00:54:37,403
<i>I hope I can trust you to keep
the secrets of the past buried,</i>

574
00:54:37,503 --> 00:54:40,204
<i>buried in a deeper grave.</i>

575
00:54:49,954 --> 00:54:52,954
